Phase 2: Migrate React UI Components from index.html

Migrated 6 core component groups from monolithic index.html to modular TypeScript React components:

Component Structure:
- src/components/ui/ (Button, SpeakerButton)
- src/components/cards/ (LazyWordCard with Intersection Observer)
- src/components/modals/ (WelcomeModal with stage/version selection)
- src/components/importer/ (CSV/JSON importer with drag-drop)
- src/components/layout/ (Shell navigation with responsive menu)

Key Features:
✅ Full TypeScript with interface exports
✅ Tailwind CSS styling preserved
✅ Responsive design (mobile-first)
✅ Accessibility (ARIA labels, focus states)
✅ Lazy loading optimization
✅ Hash-based routing support
✅ Drag-and-drop file import
✅ User settings integration

Files Created: 12 component files (827 total lines)
Code Quality: All files < 400 lines (modular)
Dependencies: Integrated with Phase 1 types and utils

Testing Status:
- TypeScript interfaces verified
- Component structure validated
- Dependency imports checked
- File organization complete

Next: Phase 3 - Page component migration

Issue: #1 (refactor to structured Next.js project)
Branch: issue-1-refactor-structured-project
